# 🧹 Power BI Data Cleaning Project #01

## 🎯 Project Goal  
I leveraged Power BI’s data cleaning tools to transform raw data, gaining hands-on experience with **data preparation** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** — all within Power BI itself.  

While I have experience with Power BI dashboards, Excel, and SQL separately, this project focused on learning to clean data directly inside Power BI.
